Using the Application

1. Once you run the application on your emulator (whether it is AVD or through a physical device such as a smartphone), the first interface you will see is an empty one, this is where the list of contacts that you will be adding 
is stored, initially it only has a Search Text Field.
2. At the top right of the app, there is an add (+) image button, click it.
3. Once you click the add button, you will be transfered to another activity which prompts you to add an image, enter a name, and enter a phone number. These are basic information in a simple phone book.
NOTE: You should supply all the needed information so that it will be saved as a Contact.
4. Once you have finished filling in all the information (image, name and number), just click the (+) Add Button below. NOTE: You can add as may as you like.
5. If you have decided not to pursue adding that contact information, just click the (x) Cancel Button below.
6. As soon as you click the add button, then you will be transfered to your main Activity which stored the list of the contact information you have added.
7. Since this is a phonebook, you can actually do basic things that a phonebook can do or had, just long press that specific contact information on the list and you can see a context menu with a variety of things that you can choose to do to that contact.
8. If you would like to send a message to that contact, click SEND SMS and you can send that contact a message whether through Messenger(if you have one it asks you to choose one) and your phone's Messaging feature.
9. While if you would like to call that contact, click CALL. At first use of the app, it will prompt you a dialog box that asks you if you will allow the app to make and manage calls, you can choose whether you allow it or deny.
10. If you allow it, then it will call that contact number immediately. NOTE: You need to have a sim load to be able to really talk to that person and/or send a message.
11. On the context menu, there is also an option wherein you can update the contact. Once you click it, you will immediately be transfered to an Update Contact interface.
NOTE: All information should be updated/edited.
12. On the context menu, you also have an option to delete the contact. Just click DELETE, and that contact will immediately be deleted on the list.
13. Lastly, on the Search bar or text field, especially when you have added many contacts already, and you are looking for a specific one, you can just type the name on the Search field and it will filter out the list and you can easily locate that contact.
